# White Label App

Welcome to the White Label App! This application has customized client builds from the same codebase. Each client application can have different features enabled or disabled based on specific requirements.

## Features

- **Customizable Client Applications**: Generate unique client applications from a single codebase.
- **Feature Flags**: Control the availability of features for each client application. Not all clients will have access to all features, allowing for tailored experiences.

## Getting Started

To get started with the White Label App, you need to set up your development environment. Follow the instructions in the [Flutter Setup Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install Flutter and configure your system.
